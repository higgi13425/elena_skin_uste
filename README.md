Retrospective data analysis of the association between the presence of autoimmune skin disease and 
the efficacy of ustekinumab in Crohn's disease, based on the hypothesis that Crohn's disease patients
with ASD are more likely to have an activated IL-23 pathway, and therefore might be more responsive to 
ustekinumab.
